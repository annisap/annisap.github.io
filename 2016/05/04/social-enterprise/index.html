It refers to the use of social media tools and conducting social network activities in organization, as written in the excellent book <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319170275#aboutAuthors" target="_blank" rel="external">“Social Commerce”</a>. IBM recommends some tools for social workflow blogs, wikis, microblogging, discussion forums, profiles and recommendation engines (people, content, or objects) to name a few. Besides providing the right enterprise social networks (ESNs) tools either public or private should build at the same time a strong collaborative culture and IT ecosystem for employees, business partners, suppliers, and customers to communicate.</p>

<h6 id="Image-Websigmas"><a href="#Image-Websigmas" class="headerlink" title="Image: Websigmas"></a>Image: <em>Websigmas</em></h6><blockquote>
<p>IDC expects the worldwide enterprise social networks market revenue to grow from $1.24 billion in 2013 to $3.5 billion by 2018.</p>
<p>Mc Kinsey predicts that the global revenue from social enterprise activities will reach 1$ trillion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We undoubtedly live in the era of the internet and more recently in this of <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="external">social networking</a> with one of the wonders of our time to be the unprecedented development and use of technologies that facilitate social interaction through Earth. Billions of people now weave a complex collection of  Twitter,  shared photos, podcasts, audio and video streams, blogs, wikis, discussion groups, and social networking sites to connect them to the world and the people they care about. The same companies should do, embrace public social networks by using Facebook, LinkedIn (the most popular business-oriented public network), and Twitter as a media for interaction with users and customers. As PEST analysis (“Political, Economic, Social and Technological”) suggests entrepreneurs should develop their strategy in alignment with the current social and technological factors. In this way, social networking services bring new challenges for addressing collaboration problems and sharing of knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McKinsey discovered that well-networked organizations delivered higher market share and profits than less-networked companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Slack with its real-time messaging and search for modern teams, many think of it as the next big social network, is a social network with most conversations to be private. Yammer, Jive and Bitrix24 are some well-known private social networks for business communication. All of them can be used to applications such as recruitment, talent management, collaboration, problem solving, marketing and.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point,  a social business is an organization that uses social networking tools fluently to communicate with people inside and outside the company so as to promote deepen customer relationships, faster generation of new ideas, identification of expertise and enable a more effective workforce. It is true that besides the confusing term of social commerce, nowadays every viable business think beyond its internal operations to its both internal and external social culture and how strong is it. Consider Starbucks, one of the masters of social networks in the world with an excellent social strategy which brand strongly emphasizes in social dimension. For instance it achieved brand awareness and customer engagement without big investments on time and budget. It organized a social media campaign ,the White Cup Contest, where fans were fostered to colour Starbucks’ white cups and submit their photos to social media using the hashtag #WhiteCupContest.</p>
<p> One recent research topic include how businesses can use social media to support business operations and how it can leverage the power of online word-of- mouth to promote customers’ engagement with brands. There is exploding interest in organizations looking for ways to increase value and competitiveness by investigating how analytics can facilitate  collaboration both internally and externally. One example is collaborative generation  and creation of ideas and solutions through crowdsourcing and online communities. Emerging   heterogeneous, voluminous, and unverified data present both opportunities and n</p>
