<p>I can visualize a time in the future when we will be to robots as dogs are to humans.<br>Claude Shannon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As cliché as it sounds technology is redefining our ecosystem. It reframes the way we think and live. The perception of reality, constitution of knowledge, functionality of memory, the habit of creativity, and language or culture experience  have all been reformed through this tech revolution. </p>
<p>Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming the operation of society, from how we diagnose illness to how we combat crime, even making it possible for a car to drive itself. These two arise new kinds of application in almost every discipline. They offer insight in many industries such as  automotive, banking, government, manufacturing and retail. Business intelligence, health care, neuroscience, social sciences and sustainable development have taken their advantage as well. One could classify these examples to e-Sciences (particle physics, bioinformatics, and medicine or genomics) and Social Computing (social network analysis, online communities stucture and detection, ideas viral and spreding). Some example use cases are brain network analysis, traffic navigation, personalized search and near earth object analysis. </p>
<p>In order to feed this area with imagination, it is important to firstly illustrate its relationship to concepts like knowledge and intelligence and then understand why Big Data and Data Science are two terms with a high synergy.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is data science?</li>
<li>Why is big data debated in relation to with the epistemic of knowledge production and data science?</li>
<li>What is the three types of intelligence that can answer sophisticad data questions?</li>
<li>How cognitive computing relates to the ‘skill’ of intelligence?</li>
<li>What is the Artificial Intelligence dark side?</li>
</ul>
<p>Data- whether it is geographical information, weather data, research data, transport data, energy consumption data, mobile data, sensor data, or health data - has become a fundamental component for the economy and our societies. Such data allow us to ask new questions and make new discoveries via the recently emerged interdisciplinary discipline of Data Science.<br>What we can learn from data was considered until now a statistician question.<br>Though, the data management and analytics carried out in conventional statistics (and other related analytic solutions) cannot address the Big Data challenges: data size is too large, messy datasets are huge and irregular, the data structure is heterogeneous, there is a variety of data representations, values are modified rapidly and their dimensionality diverse.</p>
<p>Thus, the mind-set required to wrangle, examine, and draw insight from a piece of data in no case involves only the basic statistical techniques rather also bayesian statistics, mathematics’ concepts like linear algebra and computer science skills. In addition to that, domain knowledge either this is business or some others’ context is an equally necessity in order to build sophisticated analysis models. In a word, data science is at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science and domain knowledge episteme.</p>

<p>Data science is intertwined with three kinds of intelligence: data-driven, artificial, and human. The first kind helps the other two to be formed. But let me illustrate what I mean with a question.  How is intelligence formed? Let’s answer this with the famous knowledge pyramid in order to find how data can be transformed into intelligence. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/pyramid.jpg" alt="data science"></p>

<p>Let’s admit now that intelligence is an intrinsic characteristic. It can be developed by applying the three components of a growth-mind set <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, commitment to practice <a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the definition of the desired purpose <a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  Let’s assume that the application of the first on an artificial intelligence learning algorithm is termed as contextual feature engineering or parameter optimization, the second as the training phase that learns the model’s parameters through repetition and the third one as either the testing phase or the output of product/prediction.<br>Product implies the part of Artificial Intelligence that deals with robotic process automation whereas prediction deals with the part of data analytics process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if somebody can give you a reasonable-sounding explanation [for his or her actions], it probably is incomplete, and the same could very well be true for AI.<br>It might just be part of the nature of intelligence that only part of it is exposed to rational explanation. Some of it is just instinctual, or<br>subconscious, or inscrutable.<br>Jeff Clune</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI agents have the ability to comprehend, reason and learn about how the world works and hence acquire further capabilities from mere logical computations. These abilities can developed via combining machine learning, reasoning, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision to name but just a few. </p>
<p>Cognitive computing on the other hand is AI system where there is human computer interaction in order the agent to mimic the functioning of the human brain and thus finally to be able to interact with humans naturally. Understanding user intent, make a conversation and to put simply  act like other fellows do, are some examples of cognitive computing.</p>
<p> And the most recent link in this intelligence chain is the brain computer interface, the direct communication pathway between a wired brain and an external device<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>At an  MIT review <a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> is pointed out that just as many aspects of human behavior are impossible to explain in detail, perhaps it won’t be possible for AI to explain everything it does. This is a dark side of AI  and deep learning specifically. Because if a machine takes decisions on aspects like  medicine, policing, banking, and military defense and we are unable to check how these decisions are made, then we could not validate that each society process works ‘properly’. The meaning of properly ranges across the community, for instance how a Tesla car would solve a self-driving crash dilemma differs from LeEco, a Chinese tech company. In addition to that, since machines are learning through discovering patterns in existing data produced by humans, will mimic and reinforce existing biases. A recent research<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> shows that gender and race biases are replicated by machines. The authors proved this on human language data by using a statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text and a spectrum of known biases (measured by the Implicit Association Test). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people are saying this is showing that AI is prejudiced. No. This is showing we’re prejudiced and that AI is learning it,<br>Joanna Bryson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology revealed inexistent experiences of reality and has changed the lens through which the we view the world. Many people think technology as a disruption of social relations, a reducer of creativity and big data as a troubling manifestation of Big Brother. Faults in algorithms, inaccurate hypotheses, biases on data and increased invasions of privacy can dramatically harm our reality.<br>A typical example of Big Data wrangling, constitutes the paradigm of “Google FluTrends” which was the first application of big data in the public health field. GFT was for digital prognostic of flu spread which failed catching the 2009 pandemic H1N1 because of algorithmic issues.<br>But how to validate the correctness of the output generated by machine is yet an open issue and when solved, would be considered a breakthrough.</p>
<p>In outline technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.<br>In this way Big Data and AI are just tools that we should shape with care and not let the tools shape us.</p>

<p>New materials are not necessarily superior but each material is only what we make it be,<br>Mies van der Rohe</p>
